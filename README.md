# Chortke
Chortke is a pure functional language for calculations only.
It's not a general purpose language.
It's mostly designed to solve AdventOfCode like challenges using pure functional style code.

# Syntax
Chortke is a expression based language, so each program is an expression to be evaluated.

Each expression starts with a symbol name ( expression name ) and some args passed to it seperated by space.
### example
map [1,2,3] x:x*2
